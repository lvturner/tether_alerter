## Tether Alerter
This is a really quick and dirty alterter for when a new Tether block is published. It makes use of the [say](https://www.npmjs.com/package/say) npm so it will actually read the alerts aloud to you.

I recommend using it with something like [pm2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/)

To run this you'll need Node.js Installed on your machine then, use the following commands (assuming you're using pm2)

```
npm install
pm2 start index.js
```

If all goes well you should hear your computer say "Tether Alerter Initialized"
